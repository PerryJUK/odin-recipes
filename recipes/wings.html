		<h2>We are not clucking about..</h2>
		<p>
			Ever since we bought our Traeger wood pellet grill last year, we have
			gotten a lot of use out of it. We have made brisket, pulled pork, nachos,
			burgers and more and everything has been amazing.

			Once you start smoking meat, it is hard to eat it any other way! A couple
			of weeks ago, we were invited to a Super Bowl party. We offered to bring a
			few things, including some wings. We thought about making our delicious
			buffalo wings recipe but decided that we wanted to try something new
			instead. In the end, we decided to try our hand at making smoked chicken
			wings and they were delicious.
