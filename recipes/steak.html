		<h2>The taste is to die for</h2>
		<p>
			Today’s recipe is more of a technique than a recipe – but it’s one that
			all steak lovers should know because it’s easy, worthy of using on high
			quality steaks and also a way to really elevate economical steaks.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in
			butter, garlic and thyme and baste continuously as the steak finishes
			cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter does all sorts of wonderful
			things to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and adhering to
			the crust of the steak.

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Thickish cut steak – no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to
				cook this entirely on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the
				oven). Ideal steaks: boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, porterhouse / New
				York, T-bone. Grade: takes high quality steak over the top amazing,
				really elevates economical steak.
			</li>
			<li>Butter</li>
			<li>Garlic & Thyme</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through
				evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for
				the very centre to be cooked to your liking;
			</li>
			<li>
				Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this
				helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;
			</li>
			<li>
				Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for
				the crust
			</li>
			<li>
				WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
			</li>
			<li>
				Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature
				(see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise
				as it rests; and
			</li>
			<li>
				REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in
				and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook
				hard and fast!
			</li>
		</ol>
